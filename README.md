Craigslist-Monitor - Monitor Craiglist and alert on items posted.  Useful if you want to be one of the first bidders on an item you are looking for.
Get-BlueCoat-Rating - Use BlueCoat Site Review to return the status of a website
SANS-Index-Helper - Run while taking a SANS class.  Used to build your index for the exam.
Voice-Countdown.ps1	- I use this as a countdown timer and game status timer for nerf wars.  It plays voice sounds at intervals during the game telling you how much time is left during the match.  Play your dubstep in the background and run this script to give status updates.
